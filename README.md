# Tempstation

This repository contains all the necessary files and information to make a simple thermometer with Arduino
I'll keep updating this repository as the parts arrive and I figure out what to use for a good case.

## Parts

What I'm using is an Arduino Uno board, an 16x2 LCD, 220 Î© resistor, a potentiometer, TMP-36 sensor, DS18B20 sensor, 9V battery, a switch and wires.

*pictures soon*

## Circuit

The schematic is like this.

The schematic for the circuit is included in the repo. 
_I'll also post pictures of the schematic on a breadboard as soon as I get the parts._

## Code

The code is included both in plain text and in cpp form. The code is really basic but that is all you really need. _ _For now._ _

## Case

_Soon_
